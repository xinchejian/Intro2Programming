# Introduction to Programming

1. What is programming ==> The act or process of planning or writing a program, a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable programs.
2. What is program ==> a plan of action to accomplish a specified end, a plan or schedule of activities, proceduares to be followed.

#HTML
##Hello World
## Basic html elements
<html>,<head>,<title>,<body>
<div>
<h1><h2><h3>...
<input>
<button>

* Example 1: Basic html page
* Lab 1: create your own page

#Javascript
## JQuery
##Hello World in javascript

* Example 2: Say hello (text field and a button)
* Lab 2: Say hello with time





#Programming
##Variable
In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location and an associated symbolic name (an identifier) which contains some known or unknown quantity or information, a value.
We can think variable as a grid on a shelf, and we can label it with a name.


Psudo code example: imagine in a small shop, you use a shelf to organize your income and bills, by the end of the day
````
first grid of the shelf is to store money earned from selling goods , give it a name "Earning"
second grid of the shelf is to store money made from vending machine:  give it a name "VendingMachine"
third grid of the to put a list of bills need to be paid, give it a name "Bills"
fourth grid is to store the money made for the past a few days, give it a name "Safe"
fifth grid has a note book which we can write number on, give it a name "Sum"

A simple program need to be run by the cashier by the end of the day is:
1. Put Earning into Safe
2. Put VendingMachine into Safe
3. Write 0 on Sum
4. For each of the bill, add the amount to Sum and write it on Sum
5. Take out "Sum" amount of money from the safe to pay bills
````
First operator "=" the assignment operator.


### Simple data types
1. Number: Numeric values
0, 1, 2, 3....
-1, -2, -3
0.1, 0.01, 0.001, -0.1 ....
It can be written as exponential form:   100 = 1e2 (means 1 * 10^2), 0.01 = 1e-2

Math operators: +-*/%, ++,--

2. String: Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form.
"Hello World", 'This is a line of text", "http://www.xinchejian.com/" ...

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

Common string operations:
+: "hello" + "world" gives "helloworld"
"hello".length == 5
"hello".charAt(0) == 'h'


3. Boolean: Logical value, can only be true or false
3<5 : true
2== 4: false
"hello" == "world" : false

* Example 3 and lab 3 to 
  a. use a variable to get input
  b. create a counter to count how many times the button has been clicked.
  b. display the counter with the greeting.


## Control flow
### if

if(a > b) {
  b++;
}else {
  a++;
}


### loop
for loop

while loop

do while loop



## Idea for tasks
multiplication table  ==> loop

find cube root
find prime numbers
